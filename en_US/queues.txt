menu.queues = Queues
module.queues = Queues
queues = Queues
queues.advanced = Advanced
queues.advanced_settings = Advanced Queue Settings
queues.announcement_id = Agent Message
queues.announcement_id.tooltip = A message which will be played to the agent when call is answered, typically to indicate to agents working multiple queues about the source of the call.
queues.announce_frequency = Frequency
queues.announce_frequency.placeholder = Value in seconds
queues.announce_frequency.tooltip = Defines how often to announce the caller's position in the queue, and estimated hold time. You can disable this announcement by setting the value to zero. In a small call center, it is unlikely that the system will be able to make accurate estimates, so callers could find this information frustrating.
queues.announce_holdtime = Announce Hold Time
queues.announce_holdtime.tooltip = Defines whether the estimated hold time should be included in the periodic announcement
queues.announce_position = Announce Position
queues.announce_position.limit = Limit

queues.announce_position.no.tooltip = Caller's position will not be announced
queues.announce_position.tooltip = Defines whether the caller's position in the queue should be announced. If you have any logic in your system that can promote callers (i.e. high-priority calls get moved to the front of the queue), it is best not to use this option. Callers do not like to hear that they have been moved toward the back of the queue.
queues.announce_position.yes = Yes
queues.announce_position.yes.tooltip = Caller's position will be announced
queues.announce_position_limit = Position Limit
queues.announce_position_limit.placeholder = Number

queues.autopause = Autopause
queues.autopause.all = All
queues.autopause.no = No
queues.autopause.tooltip = <b>Yes</b> enables the automatic pausing of agents who fail to answer a call. <b>No</b> disables this option. Select <b>All</b> to mark the agent as paused in all queues. This parameter can be tricky in a live environment, because if the agent does not know that they have been paused, you could end up with agents waiting for calls but not knowing that they have been paused. Never use this unless you have a way to indicate to agents that they have been paused.
queues.autopause.yes = Yes

queues.no_source_relations = No sources for this queue
queues.penaltymemberslimit = Penalty Limit

queues.periodic_announce_frequency2.tooltip = a) keeping this message short
queues.periodic_announce_frequency3.tooltip = b) not playing it too frequently
queues.periodic_announce_frequency4.tooltip = c) Pleasant music may be preferrable to endlessly repeated apologies or advertising

queues.timeoutpriority = Timeout Priority
queues.timeoutpriority.app = App
queues.timeoutpriority.conf = Conf
queues.timeoutpriority.tooltip = Control the priority of the two possible timeout options specified for a queue. The queue application has a timeout value that can be specified to control the absolute time a caller can be in the queue. The timeout value in queues.conf controls the amount of time (along with retry) to ring a agent for. Sometime these values conflict, so you can control which value takes precedence.
