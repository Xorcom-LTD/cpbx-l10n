	Android - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xorcom.cloudphone.android<br><br>
	After installing the app, just open it and scan the QR code below.<br>

cloudphone.push = Use Push Notifications
cloudphone.push.tooltip = CloudPhone devices will by default receive push notifications from a remote server that maintains connectivity to the PBX on behalf of the device. This is done to reduce battery usage on CloudPhone devices but requires the PBX to be accessible externally. Disabling push notifications will allow the CloudPhone device to make and receive calls via the local network but will reduce battery life.
cloudphone.qr_code_reset_warning = You are about to reset the device password and QR code. This action will immediately disconnect the extension's CloudPhone app. If the extension's email is set, the new QR code will be automatically sent by email to the user.
