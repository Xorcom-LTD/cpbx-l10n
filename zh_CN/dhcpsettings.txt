In order for this to work correctly, the IP address provided above for Option 66 should only consist of the IP address or hostname of the server.
dhcpsettings.range_end = End Address
dhcpsettings.range_end.tooltip = The last address on your network that can be allocated as a dynamic IP address.
dhcpsettings.range_start = Start Address
