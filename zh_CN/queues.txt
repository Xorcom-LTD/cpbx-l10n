menu.queues = 队列
module.queues = 队列
queues = 队列
queues.announcement_id = 播报
queues.announcement_id.tooltip = An announcement may be specified which is played for the member as soon as they answer a call, typically to indicate to them which queue this call should be answered as, so that agents or members who are listening to more than one queue can differentiated how they should engage the customer.
queues.announce_frequency = 播报周期
queues.announce_frequency.placeholder = Value in seconds
queues.announce_frequency.tooltip = Defines how often we should announce the caller's position and/or estimated hold time in the queue. Set this value to zero to disable. In a small call center, it is unlikely that the system will be able to make accurate estimates, and thus callers are more likely to find this information frustrating.
queues.announce_holdtime = 播报等待时间
queues.announce_holdtime.tooltip = Defines whether the estimated hold time should be played along with the periodic announcements.
queues.announce_position = 播报位置
queues.announce_position.limit = 限制

queues.announce_position.no = No
queues.announce_position.no.tooltip = The position will never be announced
queues.announce_position.tooltip = Defines whether the caller's position in the queue should be announced to her. If you have any logic in your system that can promote callers in rank (i.e., high-priority calls get moved to the front of the queue), it is best not to use this option. Very few things upset a caller more than hearing that they’ve been moved toward the back of the line.
queues.announce_position.yes = Yes
queues.announce_position.yes.tooltip = The caller's position will always be announced
queues.announce_position_limit = 播报位置限制

queues.announconf = 播报设置
queues.autofill = 自动填充
queues.autofill.tooltip = The old behavior of the queue (autofill=no) is to have a serial type behavior in that the queue will make all waiting callers wait in the queue even if there is more than one available member ready to take calls until the head caller is connected with the member they were trying to get to.
queues.autopause = 自动暂停
queues.autopause.all = 所有
queues.autopause.no = 无
queues.autopause.tooltip = Enables/disables the automatic pausing of members who fail to answer a call. Select "All" to mark this member as paused in all queues. This parameter can be tricky in a live environment, because if the agent doesn't know they've been paused, you could end up with agents waiting for calls, not knowing they've been paused. Never use this unless you have a way to indicate to the members that they've been paused, or have a supervisor who is watching the status of the queue in real time.
queues.autopause.yes = Yes
queues.description = 描述
queues.description.tooltip = Short Description for identify this queue.

queues.penalty = Penalty
queues.penalty.tooltip = We can penalize members in order to lower their preference for being called when there are people waiting in a particular queue.
queues.periodic_announcements = Periodic Announcements
queues.periodic_announcement_id = Periodic Announcement
queues.periodic_announcement_id.tooltip = Periodic announcement to reproduce, Default Message "All representatives are currently busy assisting other callers. Please wait for the next available representative.
queues.periodic_announce_frequency1.tooltip = Indicates how often we should make periodic announcements to the caller. Bear in mind that playing a message to callers on a regular basis will tend to upset them, so give some thought to:
queues.periodic_announce_frequency2.tooltip = a) keeping this message short
queues.periodic_announce_frequency3.tooltip = b) not playing it too frequently.
queues.periodic_announce_frequency4.tooltip = Pleasant music will keep your callers far happier than endlessly repeated apologies or advertising.

queues.queue_vip_list_id.tooltip = List of VIP Customers, these customers have more priority in this queue.
queues.relative_periodic_announce = Relative Periodic Announcement
queues.relative_periodic_announce.tooltip = If set to yes, the Periodic Announce Frequency timer will start from when the end of the file being played back is reached, instead of from the beginning.
queues.retry = Retry
queues.retry.placeholder = Value in seconds
queues.retry.tooltip = Specifies the number of seconds to wait before attempting the next member in the queue if the timeout value is exhausted while attempting to ring a member of the queue.
queues.ringinuse = 座席忙振铃

queues.strategy = 策略
queues.strategy.fewestcalls = 最少呼叫
queues.strategy.fewestcalls.tooltip = Ring the one with fewest completed calls from this queue.
queues.strategy.leastrecent = Least Recent
queues.strategy.leastrecent.tooltip = Ring interface which was least recently hung up by this queue
queues.strategy.linear = Linear
queues.strategy.linear.tooltip = Rings interfaces in the order specified in this queue. If you use dynamic members, the members will be rung in the order in which they were added'.
queues.strategy.random = Random
queues.strategy.random.tooltip = Ring random interface.
queues.strategy.ringall = Ring All

queues.timeoutpriority = Timeout Priority
queues.timeoutpriority.app = App
queues.timeoutpriority.conf = Conf
queues.timeoutpriority.tooltip = Used to control the priority of the two possible timeout options specified for a queue. The Queue() application has a timeout value that can be specified to control the absolute time a caller can be in the queue. The timeout value in queues.conf controls the amount of time (along with retry) to ring a member for. Sometime these values conflict, so you can control which value takes precedence.
queues.timeoutrestart = Timeout Restart
queues.timeoutrestart.tooltip = If set to yes, resets the timeout for an agent to answer if either a BUSY or CONGESTION status is received from the channel. This can be useful if the agent is allowed to reject or cancel a call.

queues.timeout.tooltip = Specifies the number of seconds to ring a member's device.
queues.type = Member 类型
queues.type.dynamic = 动态

queues.type.tooltip = Decide if the member will be: dynamic or static.
queues.weight = 队列权重
queues.weight.placeholder = Value of 0 or higher
queues.weight.tooltip = Defines the weight of a queue. A queue with a higher weight defined will get first priority when members are associated with multiple queues. Keep in mind that if you have a very busy queue with a high weight, callers in a lower-weigh queue might never get answered (or have to wait for a long time).
queues.wrapuptime = 唤醒时间
queues.wrapuptime.placeholder = Value in seconds
queues.wrapuptime.tooltip = The number of seconds to keep a member unavailable in a queue after completing a call. This time allows an agent to finish any post call processing they may need to handle before they are presented with the next call.
